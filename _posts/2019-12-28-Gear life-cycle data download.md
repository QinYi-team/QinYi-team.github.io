We have performed gear fatigue test by the FZG  gear contact fatigue test rig, and several Life-cycle vibration data sets have been acquired. The teeth numbers of gears 1, 2, 3, 4 are respectively 31, 25, 25 and 31.  The download link is listed below. More test data will be supplemented with the implementation of new gear tests.
