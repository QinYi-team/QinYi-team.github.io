We have performed gear fatigue test by the FZG  gear contact fatigue test rig, and several Life-cycle vibration data sets have been acquired. The teeth numbers of gears 1, 2, 3, 4 are respectively 31, 25, 25 and 31.  The download link is listed below. More test data will be supplemented with the implementation of new gear tests. 

The detail can be seen in Macroscopic-microscopic attention in LSTM networks based on fusion features for gear remaining life prediction. IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 2020, 67(12): 10865-10875.
